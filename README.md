# SpringBootIntegrationWithTanukiSoftware
This is sample Spring project integrated with TanukiSoftware wrapper. Here we are trying to run Spring boot application like Windows service.
You need to run "mvn clean install" or "mvn package", that will generate zip file in your target folder. extract it and run bat file from bin folder and you will see application starting as windows service.
